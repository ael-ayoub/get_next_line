The project tests your understanding of 
file I/O, memory management 
(with malloc and free), and handling
edge cases in a robust way. It's 
often a good exercise for learning
about managing dynamic memory in C.
In short, the project is about
creating an efficient and correct 
implementation of a function to read 
lines from a file descriptor, with careful
attention to performance 
and memory management.
